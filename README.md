The Obesity Prediction Dataset from Kaggle contains 2,111 entries with 17 features focused on 
predicting obesity levels. It includes demographic data like gender and age, and physical attributes such 
as height and weight. Behavioral factors like diet, physical activity, and smoking are also captured. 
Features include high-calorie food consumption (FAVC), number of meals (NCP), physical activity 
(FAF), and technology use (TUE). It also notes water intake, family obesity history, and transportation 
modes. The target variable, Obesity, classifies individuals into categories like normal, overweight, or 
obese types. The data is complete and suitable for health-related classification models.

The UrbanSound8K_Images dataset is a visual version of the UrbanSound8K audio dataset, containing 
spectrogram images of urban sound clips. It includes 10 sound classes like dog bark, siren, and drilling. 
Each image represents an audio file’s time-frequency features, making it suitable for image-based deep 
learning models. The dataset includes a CSV file with metadata like file names, sound classes, and fold 
numbers for cross-validation. Images are organized by fold for structured model training. It’s commonly 
used for sound classification, noise detection, and urban audio analysis. This dataset simplifies audio 
learning by removing the need for audio preprocessing. 
 
Project–3 
 
The Amazon Product Reviews Dataset from Kaggle contains customer reviews and ratings for various 
products sold on Amazon. It typically includes fields such as the product ID, product title, review text, 
review summary, star rating, and timestamps. This dataset is widely used for tasks like sentiment analysis, 
opinion mining, and recommendation systems. Reviews may span multiple categories, including 
electronics, books, clothing, etc. It helps understand customer satisfaction and trends based 
on written feedback. With rich textual and numerical data, it's ideal for training natural language 
processing.
